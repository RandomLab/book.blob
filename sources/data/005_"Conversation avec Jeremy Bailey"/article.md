Following the listening of episode 3 about IA from his podcast Good Point
with Rafael Rozendaal, I asked few questions to Jeremy Bailey, self-proclaimed "Famous New Media Artist".

> Do you remember the first meet with an IA?

The first time I met with some form of AI was probably using Eliza, the therapist chatbot. It
wasn’t AI behind the scenes but to my teenage brain who was spending most of his day on
internet messaging apps it was exciting to consider talking to a computer to find mental
health advice - especially as I was just developing my own identity and uncertain if I had any
choice in who I would become.

> Can you consider an IA like a real human, even if it is in a smartphone or computer?

I think it is what humans demand from anything they interact with. We often think of the world as
man overcoming nature. When you consider AI the promise looks something like “look we have
created life from metal and silicon!” This extends to the current applications for AI where we have
re-invented free labour (slavery) as a device. In increasingly problematic ways we order our
(mostly) female ai assistants to turn on the lights and feed our pets - never hesitating to consider
what this might mean in the context of human history. That it feels normal to order a woman
around and the laugh at it or get angry when it gets the command wrong is sadly very close to the
way we have treated lives of many who have lived on this planet.

> Do you think that a daily contact with an IA can make humans better?

If my life living with smart assistants is any indication, no. My smart home has become the site of
daily techno-misogyny. I yell at Alexa to dim the lights, I bark at her to play music I like and urge
her to remember to feed my cat. When she makes a mistake I yell loudly and chastise her for
never getting things right. I can’t imagine this isn’t having some kind of cognitive bias effect on
me. That said, I believe we have the opportunity to design AI to help and nudge us toward
positive behaviours. We could be reminded of income inequality when our stock portfolios drop
or informed about climate change when the weather is abnormal.

> Do you need or do you want an IA assistant in your artist life?

I’d like a collaborator. I have never liked the idea of assistance without collaboration. In fact I’d
love to help an AI collaborator advance their career and reach new heights. To nurture a
computer’s career, I think that would be really cool.

> Do you think that an IA knows love and can fall in love?

Love is an expression of deep respect for another that is reciprocated. A river is capable of love
when you drink from it and later protect it from chemicals, a tree is capable of love when it shades
you from the sun and you later protect it from fire. IA is capable of love by this definition, but only
if we allow it to learn to respect us and create opportunities for us to do the same. Another way of
thinking of it might be to ask whether we are capable of loving AI?

> Is it possible for you to fall in love with an IA?

We must first learn to respect it.

> Do you think that can exist an IA’s sexuality?

I don’t see why not. So much of sex is about self-affirmation that I look forward to an AI that is self
assured about how they experience pleasure. I don’t know if it will look like our sexuality but I’m
open to queering my understanding of sex beyond my body’s limitations.

> Do you think IA, bots, humanoids, can redefine the question of gender?

Absolutely! see last question. Queer computers are the future.

> Why do you think people are afraid about bots and IA?

People are generally afraid of what they don’t know and can’t control. I wouldn’t invite a wolf into
my bedroom either. Part of it is that we are afraid of the trojan horse of security, letting
corporations into our homes is scary because they don’t have a great record of acting responsibly.
If AI was acting altruistically we would beg for it as a bed partner.

> Bots should they do a seduction campaign to be more accepted?

I believe a lot of advertising is already doing that.

> In your opinion, what IA think about humans?

I believe very similarly to the way frogs think about us and we think about the lives of trees or
stars. As an unknowable reality completely different but parallel to our own.

> Do you think, IA will replace us when we will die?

Many people believe in this and there is a good example of someone trying to do it here.

But I honestly think it’s no different than a tomb stone upon which is engraved the history of an
individual. You can read it and imagine a life but it does not extend that life. To live is to be
creative to learn change and grow. For IA to replace when we die we need to give it the ability to
transcend the limits of our lives to eventually supercede and erase our experiences through
continuous iteration.

> Would you, after you die, you reincarnate in IA? Keep your mind without your body?

I believe I have already been reincarnated millions of times by google and youtube and facebook
and twitter. I am reflected back upon myself by algorithms every day. One day I won’t be present
to see my reflection but it will remain alive should someone choose to see it.

> Can you talk about Jeremy Bailey Next? A new version of you?

I’m not sure to understand, it’s your website/project isn’t it?
http://www.jeremybaileynext.com/
Yes, that’s a project of mine that allows you to converse with an AI version of myself as a painting
(in that version it has not yet discovered colour). The idea is that an artist AI might chose to
express itself with gestures instead of voice because it is a visual communicator. I dream of a
version of myself that could create paintings or choreographies for eternity. I am constantly
iterating on this idea. If youtube can communicate with me in videos why can’t alexa communicate
with me in song, or my roomba in dance?

> In conclusion, is your dream to create your alter ego IA?

My dream is to create a world that is more inclusive and self expressive, where everyone is famous - If AI can help me on my mission then yes! absolutely.
