<p>File this post under “well, of course they did!” Politico reports today that Israeli intelligence implanted Stingray devices near the White House and other sensitive U.S. government facilities in order to intercept the cell phone calls of Pres. Trump and presumably other officials in key foreign policy and national security positions. Though the article does not mention which other agencies were targeted you can be sure they were, at least, the State Department, National Security Council, and possibly even the NSA itself.</p></section>
