Autodidacte, il passe six années à expérimenter les réseaux neuronaux, les organismes évolutifs et l’intelligence artificielle afin de simuler l’évolution et l’activité cérébrale par ordinateur en Angleterre, où il fut gratifié d’un doctorat honorifique de l’Open University d’Angleterre, devenant ainsi membre de l’ordre des chevaliers de la Reine. Il structure et développe <em>Creatures</em>, un jeu de simulation de vie artificielle prenant place sur la planète Albia où le joueur est confronté à la tâche d’élever avec des Norns, créatures bipèdes pouvant interagir avec leur environnement, et devant vivre, apprendre et parler au sein d’un écosystème entièrement simulé. Les enzymes, les réactions chimiques, les neurones, l’ADN et les gènes des créatures, l’activité neuronale et les systèmes d’apprentissage sont accessibles au joueur, qui est chargé de la lourde responsabilité de leur apprentissage et leur maintient physiologique. Le premier opus sorti en 1996 et la dernière version du dernier épisode, <em>Creatures Exodus</em>, fut réalisé en 2004.</h6>
<h6>Steve travaille désormais sur un nouveau projet intitulé <em>Grandroids</em> au sein desquelles évoluent les Gloops, quadrupèdes modélisés en trois dimensions disposant de cerveaux maintenant capables de mouvements moteurs là où <em>Creatures</em> se déroulait sur un plan en deux dimensions, et où les Norns étaient conçus à partir d’un rapport verbe-objet-stimulis à leur monde.</h6>

  <p>Is there a difference for you between your work, what could be called artificial life (a-life) and other virtual life simulations?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Technically speaking, a-life is just a kind of theoretical biology - the use of computer simulation to explore biological ideas like evolution and growth. Different people mean different things by it and have different levels of comfort with some of its stranger ideas. But one central idea that most can agree on is that life is a process, not a thing or a substance or a property. Processes are independent of their substrate. And so, if a process occurs in a different substrate from normal (inside a computer, say), is it still the same process? If not, why not? But if it is, and if the processes of life are made to exist inside a computer, are those processes real life?</p>
<p>This is quite a difficult question, because clearly it depends. A statue is not a person, no matter how much it looks like one. A chatbot, programmed to answer medical questions, knows nothing about what it feels like to be sick, so that’s a sham too. As are the majority of virtual life sims.</p>
<p>But suppose some phenomenon emerges, whether by accident or design, from a simulation of its many tiny, lifeless component parts. Suppose it happens in exactly the same way and for the same reasons that it emerges in nature, without this behavior having been explicitly coded in. Surely it’s exactly the same phenomenon?</p>
<p>That’s what I do. I make computer simulations of biological components like nerve cells and enzymes, and then I find ways to plug them together so that they live and breathe and feel and think, without writing any code that just pretends to do those things.</p>
<p>Or indeed any code that does those things at all. If I write code to simulate a neuron, it’s clearly not a real neuron. But if I plug thousands of those pretend neurons together to make a brain and the result thinks, all by itself, then it’s not the brain’s fault that its neurons aren’t real. It’s still a real brain, and it has real thoughts. If it expresses hopes and fears about things that really matter to it, then surely they’re real hopes and fears?</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>What’s your way of seeing consciousness? Can we talk about “zophenia” as life emerging from game systems and artificial life as a phenomenon? (Zo as from old greek life and phenia from old greek “to reveal”, “appear”)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Zophenia sounds like a very good word for what I just described! As for consciousness, that’s a really tough question. For one thing nobody can agree on what the word should mean. For another, we are very prone to making mistakes in our thinking when it comes to this topic, because many of us really don’t want to believe that consciousness is a process that can be replicated.</p>
<p>We’d rather believe that it’s some kind of magical ingredient, no matter how much we try to pretend we believe nothing of the kind!</p>
<p>It seems to me that “consciousness” is a word that can be applied to many different things,because there are many levels or layers of consciousness. But a central component is the ability to think about things. Never mind whether those thoughts are intelligent or useful; it’s strange and wonderful enough just to be able to think at all. It means we have the amazing ability to disconnect our brains from the here-and-now and be somewhere else, in our minds. It’s the ability to imagine things that aren’t actually happening.</p>
<p>We humans can do this to the nth degree: We can put ourselves into somebody else’s shoes, we can think about things that don’t yet exist, or revisit our distant past, or follow the plot of a fictional narrative. It seems to me that we can do these things only because we were first able to do the easier stuff that many of our fellow creatures can do, like imagine where our prey will run next, or what will happen if we jump off this rock.</p>
<p>And that requires special equipment in our brains. Without it we are not conscious. What I’m interested in is what that equipment is like and how it works.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Can you talk a bit about your creatures’ psychology? Do they “think” like we do?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They think. Just like we do. But that doesn’t mean they think just like we do, if you see what I mean! Some birds are very smart and able to hold complex ideas in their heads, but it’s virtually impossible for us to imagine what it’s really like to be a bird. Every creature is different. But then a tractor is very different from a racing car, yet they’re both vehicles. They have some principles in common. Trying to get at the heart of what makes consciousness possible involves being able to see and replicate the principles behind it, without getting bogged down by the implementation details.</p>
<p>This isn’t easy. We’ve had several decades of neural network research based on the wrong characteristics of neurons. We don’t know which characteristics matter, nor how neurons are organized into brains. We literally have almost no idea how the brain works – what its basic engineering principles are - despite the hard work of thousands of researchers. So we probably can’t solve this analytically; it needs instead to be a creative art. After forty years of trying to develop my art, I came up with some ideas I thought were worth experimenting with, and so far they do seem to work. But whether this is how you and I think, I’ve no idea…</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Tim Ingold’s notion of “ecology of life” stands that any being should be thought according to its whole connexions to its world : How those virtual beings you created are connected to their world? Is it some ecosystemic relationship ?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don’t think there are boundaries between us and our world either, are there? Not real ones. 90% of the cells in my body are bacteria. They’re not related to me but I can’t live without them. They’re me. But if you and I shake hands, some of me will become you and some of you will become me. The remaining 10% of my cells, which do actually have human DNA in them, are really just tiny single-celled creatures in their own right; descendants of the same ancestor. It’s just that they happen to be stuck together and have to rely on each other to survive. If that’s not weird enough, some perfectly ordinary people amongst us started out as two twins, who fused together to become one being! Meanwhile, I am, in part, what I ate for dinner yesterday. In a few years I won’t be made from any of the stuff I’m made from today at all… So we’re not nearly as separate and discrete as we like to think!</p>
<p>Connections are all there is. Relationships are all that exists. And this is true in computer code too. At least, in interesting computer code. The first thing I do when I start programming is to try to turn the neat, logical, one-thing-at-a-time digital computer into a mass of messy, simultaneous, analogue relationships.</p>
<p>I totally agree that any being should be thought of according to its whole connections to its world. In fact I’d go so far as to say that this network of connections is all that a being consists of. So yes, one of the wonderful things about software, for me, and especially about true artificial life software, is that we are able to dissolve away all the “stuff ” and be left with just the relationships. If we dig a bit deeper, we can start to glimpse that even the “stuff ” was really just tiny relationships all along…</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>In <em>Creatures</em>, the players share with the norns the same language that is (as I see it) the core of the player interaction with them as well as the way they understand their world. How did you designed this system? How much the langage entangled the ecosystem, the creatures, the player?
  Will also Grandroids have a language system implemented?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I basically added language to Creatures as an afterthought (après coup?) but I think people did find it quite important. It never really worked properly, because the creatures tended to hear each other say something and then say it back, which caused the first creature to say it again, and so on. They would stand in corners yelling the same word at each other over and over again!</p>
<p>Real language is one of the highest achievements of the brain, and obviously I couldn’t create artificial brains capable of doing anything nearly as complex as we do. But I believe that the basic elements of language – subject, verb and object, qualified by adverbs and adjectives – are also the basic elements of thought and intelligence. Life is about doing things to other things – “hit the red ball hard with the big hammer.” And so it was quite easy to make simple sentences “map onto” the actions that creatures learned to do, so that saying something to them would make them “think” to do that thing.</p>
<p>Allowing them to learn words for themselves, in the user’s own language, was easy for nouns. If you show a creature a ball and type “ball” or “balle”, then the creatures’ brains would pay attention to the ball and associate the word with what they were paying attention to.</p>
<p>For verbs it was harder. You couldn’t SHOW a creature what walking or kissing or kicking is like, since they couldn’t see you. And you couldn’t even wait until they chose to walk, kiss or kick and then say the word for it, because you could never be quite sure what their intentions were in sufficient time. So I made a “teaching machine” that would stimulate their brain AS IF they were about to kick something, and then stimulate their brain AS IF they’d heard whatever word the user wanted them to associate with it. I made playing with the teaching machine fun for creatures to do, and so they were quite happy to learn the words for actions.</p>
<p>For Grandroids I have a slightly more complex (and probably even more useless!) method inside their brains, but essentially it works the same way – they learn to associate one thing (a word) with another (an action or an object). This time they start out with a “baby talk” vocabulary from the moment they’re born, but the users can then record their own voice to “teach” them new words. I then adjust the sound of the user’s voice to make it into the creature’s voice (I give it a higher pitch, mostly), so that the creatures will say the words the user “taught” them. But that part is just programming – the creatures’ brains don’t have to learn how to understand actual sounds, nor learn to make them by controlling their mouths and vocal chords.</p></section>
