<p>If used to make non-heritable genetic changes, CRISPR gene-editingtechnology holds tremendous promise for treating or curing a wide range ofdevastating disorders, including sickle cell disease, vision loss, and musculardystrophy. Early efforts to deliver CRISPR-based therapies to affected tissuesin a patient’s body typically have involved packing the gene-editing tools intoviral vectors, which may cause unwanted immune reactions and other adverse effects.</p></section>

<p>It’s a race against time when someone suffers a stroke caused by a blockage of a blood vessel supplying the brain. Unless clot-busting treatment is given within a few hours after symptoms appear, vast numbers of the brain’s neurons die, often leading to paralysis or other disabilities. 
It would be great to have a way to replace those lost neurons. </p></section>
