<p>Ce livre est une expérience. Sur le plan technique, il s'agit de programmer l'ensemble de la création de l'ouvrage, de son écriture à la mise en forme, de concevoir une chaîne unique avec un point d'entrée, une graine et un point de sortie, un livre.</p>
<p>Intitle, intext, inurl, et bien d’autres expressions sont des opérateurs de recherche proposés par le moteur de google. Combinées à des mots-clés , elles permettent de faire remonter des informations souvent noyées dans le flux d'informations indexées en masse par les algorithmes de Google (par exemple, la chaîne de caractère <em>site:reddit.com intitle:peace</em> ne retournera que les pages web qui appartiennent à un domaine, celui de reddit et dont le titre contient l'expression: <em>peace</em>). Considéré comme une méthode passive d’extraction d’informations, le google dorking est utilisé par les communautés spécialisées dans les techniques de sécurité informatique, c'est une solution pour exposer les failles des sites internet et des bases de données.</p>
<p>Dans le contexte de cet ouvrage, cette technique fonde la mise en œuvre d’un programme informatique conçu pour glaner des informations sur le web, la graine utilisée comme donnée entrante est ici un mot ou plusieurs mots.<br />
À partir des réponses obtenues après une première recherche, le programme récolte des adresses URL, il extrait les textes et images les plus pertinents et isole des nouveaux mots qu’il stocke dans un corpus. Ce corpus sert ensuite à nourrir de nouvelles recherches et toutes ses recherches produisent des documents qui deviendront ensuite des chapitres et des articles. À intervalle régulier, le corpus est remis à zéro. L’ensemble est réuni dans une publication dont la chaîne éditoriale, de l’écriture à la mise en forme typographique est entièrement automatisée.<br />
<br><br><br></p>
<h1>Les presses d’URL</h1>
<p><em>Les presses d’URL</em> est une collection de publications conçues en coopération avec des agents automatisés et des systèmes informatiques de recherche et de traitement textuel. Les sources des données manipulées par les agents sont le plus souvent issues du world wide web mais pas nécessairement, la plus petite unité n'est pas un caractère typographique mais une donnée traîtée par un programme informatique. L'ensemble des outils utilisés (langages de programmation, logiciels, mise en page, polices de caractères) ainsi que les productions (code source) de la collection sont sous licences libres.</p>

<p>Computer hackers are normally thought of as nefarious individuals who hide in the dark web of the internet and look to launch attacks that will make them money or serve their interests. But in reality, the hacking community is made up of various groups that each have their own intentions, some of which may be good or evil.</p></section>

<p>Zhou Yi was terrible at math. He risked never getting into college. Then a company called Squirrel AI came to his middle school in Hangzhou, China, promising personalized tutoring. He had tried tutoring services before, but this one was different: instead of a human teacher, an AI algorithm would curate his lessons. </p></section>

From collapsing hydrogen clouds into stars to gluing galaxies together, gravity represents one of just a few players that determine the broad strokes of the universe's evolution.&nbsp;</p></section>

<p>It’s a race against time when someone suffers a stroke caused by a blockage of a blood vessel supplying the brain. Unless clot-busting treatment is given within a few hours after symptoms appear, vast numbers of the brain’s neurons die, often leading to paralysis or other disabilities. 
It would be great to have a way to replace those lost neurons. </p></section>
